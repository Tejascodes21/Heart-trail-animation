ðŸ’– Heart Trail Animation
This is a simple JavaScript animation that creates a heart trail effect following the cursor. As you move your mouse across the screen, cute little hearts appear at the cursor's position and fade away as they float upwards, creating a fun and playful visual effect.

ðŸ“‚ How It Works
The script listens for mouse movement and dynamically creates heart-shaped elements at the cursor's location. Each heart is:

Styled with CSS for color, size, and animation

Positioned absolutely on the page

Programmatically animated (or styled with CSS transitions) to float upward and fade out

Automatically removed from the DOM after the animation completes

This effect is achieved with just a few lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into any webpage.
